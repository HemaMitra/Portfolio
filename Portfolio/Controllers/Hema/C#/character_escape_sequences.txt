C# defines the following character escape sequences:

\' - single quote, needed for character literals
\" - double quote, needed for string literals
\\ - backslash
\0 - Unicode character 0
\a - Alert (character 7)
\b - Backspace (character 8)
\f - Form feed (character 12)
\n - New line (character 10)
\r - Carriage return (character 13)
\t - Horizontal tab (character 9)
\v - Vertical quote (character 11)
\uxxxx - Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value xxxx
\xn[n][n][n] - Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value nnnn (variable length version of \uxxxx)
\Uxxxxxxxx - Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value xxxxxxxx (for generating surrogates)
Of these, \a, \f, \v, \x and \U are rarely used in my experience.
